## Cloud Research

About 2 weeks ago I started studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate but I've been slacking off a bit.  
Today I decided to repeat the content that I already had processed.

### Topics:

- General topics: DNS, CDN, Serverless
- Compute: EB, EC2, Lambda
- Networking: Route 53, VPC

I'm also currently creating a blog to post my notes and tutorials on.  
I'm planning to update the blog on a weekly basis but it can be more depending om my schedule.
